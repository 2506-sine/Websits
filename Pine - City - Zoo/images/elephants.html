                            <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                            <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing, among other uses.
                        Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and each individual can either be left- or right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear and tear.
                        Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. 
                        hey can also be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.</p>
                        <p>Elephants are herbivores, which means they eat plants. They eat a variety of plants, including grasses, fruits, leaves, and bark. They can consume up to 300 pounds of food in a single day!</p>
                        <p>Elephants are social animals and live in groups called herds. A herd is usually made up of related</p>
                        <p>Two genetically different African species exist: the savanna elephant and the forest elephant, with a number of characteristics that differentiate them both. 
                        The African savanna elephant is the largest elephant species, while the Asian forest elephant and the African forest elephant are of a comparable, smaller size.</p>
                        <p>Elephants are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and strong family bonds. They are also known for their long memories and ability to communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations and body language.</p>
                        <p>Elephants are found in a variety of habitats, including savannas, forests, and grasslands. They are native to Africa and Asia, and their populations are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their ivory tusks.</p>

                        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
