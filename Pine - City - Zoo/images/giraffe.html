                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                            <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, known for their long necks and legs. They are native to Africa and are easily recognized by their distinctive coat patterns, which vary among individuals. Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees and shrubs. Their long necks allow them to reach high branches that other herbivores cannot access.</p>
                            <p>Giraffes are social animals that live in loose herds, often consisting of females and their young, while males may form bachelor groups or live alone. They communicate using a variety of sounds, body postures, and even infrasonic frequencies that are inaudible to humans.</p>
                            <p>Giraffes have a unique cardiovascular system that allows them to maintain blood flow to their brains while bending down to drink water. Their long legs and necks also help them spot predators from a distance, giving them an advantage in the wild.</p>
                            <p>Giraffes are known for their gentle and calm demeanor, making them a popular attraction in zoos and wildlife parks. They are also important for their role in maintaining the health of their ecosystems by browsing on trees and shrubs, which promotes new growth and biodiversity.</p>
                            <p>In summary, giraffes are fascinating creatures that are well-adapted to their environment. Their unique physical characteristics, social behavior, and ecological role make them a beloved species among wildlife enthusiasts and conservationists alike.</p>
                            <p>  Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males but are gregarious and may gather in large groups.
                             Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon.
                             Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for rearing the young.</p>
                         <p>Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees and shrubs. Their long necks allow them to reach high branches that other herbivores cannot access.</p>
