                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
                            <p>The koala is a marsupial native to Australia, known for its distinctive appearance and unique lifestyle. Koalas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on eucalyptus leaves, which are their main source of food. They are known for their slow-moving, sedentary lifestyle, spending most of their time sleeping in trees.</p>
                            <p>Koalas are often associated with their cute, cuddly appearance, characterized by their large, round ears, black nose, and fluffy fur. They have strong limbs and sharp claws that help them climb trees and navigate their arboreal habitats. Koalas are also known for their unique vocalizations, which include grunts and bellows.</p>
                            <p>Koalas are primarily nocturnal, meaning they are most active at night. They spend most of their day sleeping in trees, where they can be safe from predators. Koalas are also known for their strong sense of smell, which helps them locate eucalyptus leaves and identify potential mates.</p>
                            <p>Koalas are native to the eucalyptus forests of eastern and southeastern Australia. They are well-adapted to their habitats, with a specialized diet that allows them to thrive on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and high in toxins. Koalas have a unique digestive system that helps them break down the tough leaves and extract the necessary nutrients.</p>
                            <p>In summary, the koala is a unique and fascinating marsupial that is well-adapted to its arboreal lifestyle. With its distinctive appearance, specialized diet, and sedentary behavior, it is a beloved symbol of Australian wildlife.</p>
                            <p>Koalas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on eucalyptus leaves, which are their main source of food. They are known for their slow-moving, sedentary lifestyle, spending most of their time sleeping in trees.</p>
                            <p>Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south.
                            These populations are possibly separate subspecies, but not all researchers accept this.</p>
                            <p>Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial; only mothers bond to dependent offspring. 
                            Adult males communicate with bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests.
                            Like other marsupials, koalas give birth to young known as joeys at a very early stage of development. </p>

                        <strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong>
                        <p>You will find the koalas at pen E26, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
