                            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                            <p>Monkeys are a diverse group of primates that are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and agility.
                            They are typically characterized by their long limbs, prehensile tails, and expressive faces.
                            Monkeys are found in a variety of habitats, including tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountains.
                            They are known for their complex social structures, which can include large groups or smaller family units.
                            Monkeys are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of foods, including fruits, nuts, seeds, and insects.
                            They are also known for their impressive climbing abilities, which they use to navigate their arboreal habitats.
                            Monkeys are highly social animals, often living in large groups called troops.
                            They communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language.  
                            Monkeys are also known for their playful behavior, which includes swinging from branches, chasing each other, and playing with objects.
                            In summary, monkeys are intelligent and social primates that are well-adapted to their environments.
